# Nightingale - Encrypted Mailing
A common nuisance in today's world of texting is the possibility of someone eavesdropping or straight up stealing your device to have a snoop.

Nightingale helps circumvent this by giving you the option of sending and receiving encrypted messages which you can send to your peers.

This is an ongoing project with a lot of potential for improvement.
